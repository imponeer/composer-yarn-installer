# Composer Yarn Installer

Composer extension that installs [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to vendor bin path.

## Usage

Easiest way to do that is to execute composer command from console:

```bash
composer require imponeer/composer-yarn-installer
```

## Versioning

The package will be automatically updated each time when new yarn version is released.

So, if you need to use specific yarn version for example 0.11.x, you can specify in composer.json with `"imponeer/composer-yarn-installer":"0.11.*"` line.
